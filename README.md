This is a short assignment in which I was asked to create a page that would allow someone to make a booking for a fictional IT training course in various disciplines. 
The backend of the page is written entirely in PHP and makes use of a MYSQL database to keep track of bookings and times.
Users are asked to enter their preferred course, and the slot and time they wish to attend, then enter their email and check to see if a booking can be made.
This assignment demonstrates how to use PHP to access a SQL database using PDO Objects as well as using regex searches to check the validity of the information entered by the user.

The page itself can be accessed by copying and pasting the following url:
